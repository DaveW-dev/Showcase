# Showcase

This is just a small showcase for applying what I am leaning about Unity development. 

Everything is made by myself from scratch, with the exception of the state machine-based scripting being started from [this blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/building-third-person-controller-unity-new-input-system/), then further extended and modified by myself.
